  <p>This manual will use the {tag 'pad'} tag for general PAD features.
  <p>Below the internal PHP code for the {tag 'pad'} tag. That is not so much ))</p>
  <p>{example 'miscellaneous/true', skipHeader, skipPad, skipResult}</p>
  <p>As the {tag 'pad'} tag does not do anything itself, it must be given content & data. 
  <br>(if there is no data is assigned then it will have default 1 occurence)
